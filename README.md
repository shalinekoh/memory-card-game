# Pokemon Memory Card Game

Pokemon Memory Card Game is an engaging memory game built with React. The objective is simple: click on each card without selecting any card more than once. Each successful click increases your current score. However, if a card is clicked twice, the game ends, and your score resets.

## Features

Random Pokemon Images: Integrates with the Pokemon API to display images of different pokemons. 
Score Tracking: Dynamically updates and displays the current score and the high score.
Game Over: Ends the game if a card is clicked twice.
Card Shuffle: Cards shuffle after every click to increase the challenge.
